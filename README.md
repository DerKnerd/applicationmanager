# Application manager
The application manager is a simple android app written by me to manage my job applications.

## How it works
The app is designed to manage job applications through agencies. Therefore the app has three categories.

### Agencies
The first category is agencies. Here you can manage all agencies you stand in contact with. You can easily add new agencies by clicking the New button.

### Agents
The second category are agents. The agents are assigned to an agency and you can add them from the start screen or from the agency detail page.

### Applications
The last category are applications that agents sent for you. You can add an application via the start screen, the agency detail page or the agent detail page.

## Upcoming features
Currently it is not possible to reassign applications or agents. This needs to be implemented.
